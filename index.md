What Is a [Place Card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_card)?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

A conventional place card is a decorated miniature card that shows your guests their seat location in an event. However, place cards can double up as meal guides for the catering services. These stylish cards create stunning displays and enable you to control the celebrantsâ€™ sitting arrangement.

What Is a [Place Card Template](https://www.docformats.com/place-card/)?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

A place card template is a ready-made, customizable paper or card you fill with details that guide an individual attendee to their particular seat, then print and designate to your guests. Place cards templates save you the hassle of designing one yourself. You have multiple styles and embellishments options for place card templates from glorious gold to matte finish. The secret is to find a template that matches your eventâ€™s theme and customize it.

Place Card vs. Escort Card
--------------------------

Wedding planners often use the terms "place card" and "escort card" interchangeably, but they have distinct purposes. At first glance, they may seem similar, but upon closer examination, you'll notice subtle differences. An escort card directs guests to their assigned table, while a place card guides them to both their table and their specific seat.

Both place cards and escort cards can share similar elements and designs that align with your event's theme.

What is the standard size of a place card?
------------------------------------------

Standard place cards measure 10cm by 6 cm. However, some designers custom create larger cards. Make a place card slightly larger than a typical business card when you canâ€™t find a large enough template online.
